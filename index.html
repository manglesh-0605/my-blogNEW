                <h3>Html</h3>
                <p>Html is the building block of any website on the web . 
                    It is used to design the structure of the website.
                    the extension of the html page is .html or .htm 
                    You don't need to be a master of html to be a web developer just learn enough to get started.

                <p>Css is used to style your webpage the structure that you prepare using html is not that goodlooking , so you need css to style it . To make it look beautiful.There are 3 ways to write css for a html page.<br>
                <strong>1.</strong>You can write css in the element itself using style tag.
                eg. <code>&lt;h1&gt; style="color:red"This is content of the heading&lt;/h1&gt;</code><br>
                <strong>2.</strong>In between head tag you can define style Element and write css there.<br>
                <strong>3.</strong>In a separate .css file and you can link it to hhtml page using link element.
